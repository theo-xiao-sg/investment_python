# Backtesting a well known investment stratergy with python

I backtested a well know investment stratergy with python called SMA 200 to find out if it is really worth its value, and I found out that it was not.
 
## Running Guide

This project is based on the Python programming language and primarily utilizes standard libraries like yfinance, datetime, matplotlib and os

### Environment Setup

Download the requirements.txt and install the required Python libraries. Please note all my 4 projects share the same requirements.txt. If you have done the installation for one project, you can skip it for the other 3 projects

```bash
# install all packages using requirements.txt
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Trying it out
Feel free to change the ticker to any stock and the SMA to any day you want and see the results. However, the results will all be the same: SMA is not worth its value.
